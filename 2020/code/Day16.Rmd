# cyclePolygonsC <- cycleWaysC$osm_polygons

# PolygonsB & C have 0 observations so I can discard them. PolygonsA are all marked as private. I want only the ones which the general public has access to, so I'm going to ignore the rest of it.

# Keep only needed info. I'm keeping only those marked explicitly as yes to bicycles. I'm also going to discard cycleLinesC.
