## Get Data

``` r
# Load Bangalore ward boundaries

bangaloreWardBoundary <- read_sf(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreWardBoundary.shp"))

bangaloreWardBoundary <- bangaloreWardBoundary%>% 
  st_transform(3857)
```

``` r
# Get bus stop data from OSM
#  
# query <- getbb("Bangalore") %>%
#   opq() %>%
#   add_osm_feature("highway", "bus_stop")
# 
# str(query)
# 
# busStops <- osmdata_sf(query)
# 
# saveRDS(busStops, here::here("data/raw-data/busStops.rds"))

busStops <- readRDS(here::here("data/raw-data/busStops.rds"))
```

``` r
# Load roads data (previously saved from OSM and cleaned up)

bangaloreRoads <- readRDS(here::here("data/derived-data/bangaloreRoads.rds"))
```

``` r
# Get train station data. I need the RV Road Station
# name == "Rashtriya Vidyalaya Road"
# 
# query <- getbb("Bangalore") %>%
#   opq() %>%
#   add_osm_feature("public_transport", "stop_position")
# 
# str(query)
# 
# publicTransportStops <- osmdata_sf(query)
# 
# saveRDS(publicTransportStops, here::here("data/raw-data/publicTransportStops.rds"))

publicTransportStops <- readRDS(here::here("data/raw-data/publicTransportStops.rds"))
```

## Wrangle data

``` r
# Intersect roads and ward boundary

bangaloreRoads <- st_intersection(bangaloreRoads, bangaloreWardBoundary)
```

    ## Warning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout all
    ## geometries

``` r
# I'll exclude residential roads from this

bangaloreRoads <- bangaloreRoads %>% 
  filter(highway != "residential")
```

``` r
# Extract point locations

bangaloreBusStops <- busStops$osm_points

# Transform data

bangaloreBusStops <- bangaloreBusStops %>% 
  st_transform(3857)

# Clip to boundary

bangaloreBusStops <- st_intersection(bangaloreBusStops, bangaloreWardBoundary)
```

    ## Warning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout all
    ## geometries

``` r
# Get all the metro station locations

publicTransportStops <- publicTransportStops$osm_points

metroStations <- publicTransportStops %>% 
  filter(network == "Namma Metro")

# Keep only relevant info

metroStations <- metroStations %>% 
  select(osm_id, name, geometry) %>% 
  st_transform(3857)

metroStations <- metroStations %>% 
  arrange(name)

# I'm just going to keep one point for each station

metroStations <- metroStations %>% 
  group_by(name) %>% 
  slice(1)

# The Majestic station is repeated so I'll filter manually by name

metroStations <- metroStations %>% 
  filter(name != "Nadaprabhu Kempegowda Station, Majestic (Green Line)")

metroStations <- metroStations %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  st_transform(3857)
```

``` r
# Now I want to identify the bus stops which are in a 500m buffer of the metro stations. First, I'll draw a buffer around all the metro stations

metroStationsBuffer <- st_buffer(metroStations, 1000)

metroStationsBufferU <- st_union(metroStationsBuffer)

# Find the bus stops within a 500 radius

busStopsInBuffer <- st_intersection(bangaloreBusStops, metroStationsBuffer)
```

    ## Warning: attribute variables are assumed to be spatially constant throughout all
    ## geometries

``` r
busStopsInBuffer <- busStopsInBuffer %>% 
  select(osm_id, geometry, `name.1`) %>% 
  rename(stationName = `name.1`)

busStopsInBuffer %>% 
  group_by(stationName) %>% 
  count(osm_id) %>% 
  summarise(count = sum(n)) %>% 
  arrange(count) %>% 
  view()
```
