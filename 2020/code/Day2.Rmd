## Get Data

```{r}
# Load Bangalore ward boundaries

bangaloreWardBoundary <- read_sf(here::here("data/raw-data/bangaloreWardBoundary.shp"))

bangaloreWardBoundary <- bangaloreWardBoundary%>% 
  st_transform(3857)
```

```{r}
# Load roads data (previously saved from OSM and cleaned up)

bangaloreRoads <- readRDS(here::here("data/derived-data/bangaloreRoads.rds"))
```

## Wrangle Data

```{r}
# Count number of categories

# bangaloreRoads %>% 
#   group_by(highway) %>% 
#   count()

# There are 6 colours. So, I'll use a 7 or 8 color palette.

```

## Build Map

```{r}
# Define palette
