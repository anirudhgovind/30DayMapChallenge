# 30DayMapChallenge

This repo contains all the code I used to create maps for the #30DayMapChallenge 2020 (started by Topi Tjukanov in 2019). The themes for the maps are defined in the image below.

All my maps are about Bangalore, India and rely on data from open sources, primarily OpenStreetMap.

## Day 26 - COVID-19

**Tweet**: *"A very work in progress map today. Day 25's (#30DayMapChallenge) theme is COVID-19. I was trying to figure out how much space we would need if all 12,326,532 people of #Bangalore decided to stand 2m apart. If my math is right, they'd all fit in a circle with radius 2607m. I highly underestimated the amount of time 2,054,422 tiny hexagons would take to render so here is a much more computationally lighter map. The circle shown has a radius of 3000m. #30DayMapChallenge #Bangalore #Bengaluru #bloremapped #maps #rspatial"*
